# DNS_Server_Simulation

This is a Practical Implementation of DNS Server/Protocol working 

A Domain Name System (DNS) turns domain names into IP addresses, which allow browsers to get to websites and other internet resources. It is an Terminal based project where user can enter the website name he wish to view like we do in our browser seach tab and then we get the IP Addresses by searching in the JSON file, after searching the requested site the program returns the requested site in the form of clickable IP Address featched from the JSON file, which after clicking redirects directly to the requested site.
